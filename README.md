### What I learned

I learnt about CSS variables and how to use them

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

  --paragraph-f-s: 15px;
}

```



### Continued development
In the future I will learn more about CSS processor like SCSS processor
